Room[ease] is a roommate matching web application that helps users find compatible roommates in their area. After signing up, users take a quick compatibility survey about themselves and what they want in a roommate. Upon submitting, users are shown the top matches in their area sorted by compatibility percentage. Users have the option to email their matches in app.

## Roommate Compatibility Matching Algorithm Logic
Instead of being based on sameness, the room[ease] matching algorithm takes both a user's answers about themselves AND their preferences for potential roommates into consideration.

- All questions about the user were either/or. For example, the about personality asks, "Are you introverted or extroverted?" 
- Questions about roommate preference have three options. For example: "Do you prefer a roommate who is introverted or extroverted?" There are three options for that: introverted, extroverted, and don't care. 
- Based on these answers for this category, 2 users could be a 100%, 50%, or 0% match. 
- After all 8 questions are completed, the percentages across the questions are averaged for a total compatibility percentage. 

## Compatibility Example

User 1: Extroverted (herself), Don't Care (for roommate)
User 2: Introverted, Introverted
User 3: Extroverted, Extroverted
- User 1 and User 2 would have 50% compatibility. User 1's preferences would be met, but User 2's wouldn't be.
- User 2 and User 3 would have 0% compatibility. Neither users' preferences would be met.
- User 3 and User 1 would have 100% compatibility. Both users' preferences would be met.
